# Clean MVC
Custom PHP MVC Framework for bespoke PHP websites and systems.

# Configuration
There are several setups needed which can all be found in the config.php `app/config/config.php`

# Database
At the moment there isnt a setup file for configuring the database as its very early days in the project. For now you can use the sql file found at the root of the project to setup to solitary table.
